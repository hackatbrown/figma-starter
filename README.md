# Figma Starter

Hi, welcome to Hack@Brown's Figma starter kit. We will go over the basics of how to use Figma 
to design, prototype, and collaborate on beautiful UI/UX designs. Figma is a cloud-based design 
platform that allows teams to create and iterate on visual designs together in real time. 
It’s widely used for UI/UX design, prototyping, and building reusable design systems, all 
without needing to install heavy software and seamless transition to further development. 

## Getting Started:
### Set up Figma:
If you have not previoulsy used Figma,
1. Head to https://www.figma.com/ and create an account.
2. (Optional) Download the Figma desktop app for smoother performance.
### Learn the basics:
Here are some basic concepts and tools that you can use in Figma:
#### Style Guide
Use this page to define your project’s visual identity.
Colors: Primary, secondary, accent, and background tones.
Typography: Heading, subheading, and body text styles.
Components: Buttons, input fields, and common UI elements with Auto Layout.
This page acts as your “design system” — update it once, and reuse styles across pages.

#### Wireframes
Low-fidelity layouts for brainstorming and structure.
Use grey boxes and simple labels (“Image”, “Button”, “Text Block”).
Build both Desktop (1440x1024) and Mobile (390x844) versions.
Focus on layout, not color or polish yet.

#### Mockups
High-fidelity designs that use your style guide’s colors and components.
Replace wireframe boxes with actual components.
Apply shadows, gradients, icons, and imagery.
Include one desktop and one mobile layout to show responsiveness.

#### Prototype
Create linked, clickable flows for demos or testing.
Use Prototype Mode (top-right in Figma).
Connect buttons to other frames.

Add transitions (“Instant”, “Smart Animate”, etc.) for smooth navigation.
If you would like to learn more, please reference the following links as well as explore the
Figma website itself (ex: Design Resources tab) that already has a ton of packages and tutorials:

### Collaborating as a team:
Figma is real-time and built for teamwork. Here are some basic ways to take advantage of the
the collaborative aspect of Figma:
- Invite teammates using the “Share” button.
- Use Comments (C key) to give feedback directly on frames.
- Create a shared “Notes” frame to track design decisions and open questions.
- Keep one teammate as the “design system manager” to avoid inconsistent styles.
### Dev Mode:
Dev Mode in Figma allows for seamless connection between design and development by letting developers inspect, copy, and export design details directly from the file. After creating a Figma design you are happy with, you can switch on Dev Mode to access specs like spacing, colors, font styles, and component names without altering the design itself. You can also copy production-ready CSS, iOS, or Android code snippets for faster handoff and integration.

## Instructions:
This starter pack contains a .json file that has a template for many of the features mentioned 
above. In order to use it as a starting point for your Figma design, follow these steps:
1. Download the figma-starter-template.json file from this repo
2. Open Figma and in the search bar search "json importer". From the search results, install the Figma Importer Plugin.
3. Launch the plugin in the workspace of your choice. 
4. Click "import JSON" and select the figma-starter-template.json file you just downloaded or alternatively just copy and paste the code from the json file directly into the importer.
